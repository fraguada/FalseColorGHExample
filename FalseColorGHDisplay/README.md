# False Color GH Example

This project is an example of how to override preview display in Grasshopper for Brep objects. 
Takes a list of Brep objects and adds a False Color Mesh colored according to the vertex position in a Bounding Box.

Developed in VS 2017.
Works in Rhino 5 sr12 and above, Grasshopper 0.9.0076 and above (I think).

Uses Nuget packages for Grasshopper SDK 0.9.0076 and RhinoCommon 5.12.
